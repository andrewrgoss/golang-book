**What is the difference between an identifier that starts with a capital letter and one which doesnâ€™t? (`Average` vs `average`)**

In Go if something starts with a capital letter that means other packages (and programs) are able to see it. If we had named the function average instead of Average our main program would not have been able to see it.
