**Why do we use packages?**

There are 3 primary benefits to using packages:

*They reduce the chance of having overlapping names. This keeps our function names short and succinct.
*They organizes code so that its easier to find code you want to reuse.
*They help speed up the compiler by only requiring recompilation of smaller chunks of a program. Although we use the package fmt, we don't have to recompile it every time we change our program.
