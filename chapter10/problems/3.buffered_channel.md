**What is a buffered channel? How would you create one with a capacity of 20?**

A buffered channel does not run at the same time as another channel (it is asynchronous). It will not wait to send or receive a message unless the channel is already full. Normally both sides of a channel will wait until the other side is ready.

A buffered channel with a capacity of 20 could be created this way:

`c := make(chan int, 20)`
