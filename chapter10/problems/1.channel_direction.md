**How do you specify the direction of a channel type?**

A direction on a channel type can be specified thus restricting it to either sending or receiving. (`<-` or `->`)

`func pinger(c chan<- string)`

With the directional arrow applied above, `c` can only be sent to. Attempting to receive from c will result in a compiler error.
