**We know that (in base 10) the largest 1 digit number is 9 and the largest 2 digit number is 99. Given that in binary the largest 2 digit number is 11 (3), the largest 3 digit number is 111 (7) and the largest 4 digit number is 1111 (15) what's the largest 8 digit number? (hint: 101-1 = 9 and 102-1 = 99)**

The largest number you can represent with 8 bits is 11111111, or 255 in decimal notation (base 10). 00000000 is the smallest, so you can represent 256 things within a byte.

One byte = 8 bits

Bits can only be 1 or 0, each position in the list of bits represents some power of two. 1001 means one eight plus no fours plus no twos plus one extra. This is called binary notation. You can convert numbers from binary notation to decimal notation, but you seldom have to.

Another example: 1111 (15)
1___ = 8 +
_1__ = 4 +
__1_ = 2 +
___1 = 1
