**What is a string? How do you find its length?**

A string is a sequence of characters with a definite (immutable) length used to represent text. Go strings are made up of individual bytes, usually one for each character. 

The built-in `len` function in Go can be used to find the length of a string:

```go
len("Hello world") // length = 11, not 10 (a space is also considered a character)
```

`len(<string>)`
