**Why would you use an embedded anonymous field instead of a normal named field?**

When defined this way, this field can be accessed using the type's name. Sometimes a "is-a" relationship is preferred over "has-a". For example:

```go
type Planet struct {
	Name string
	OrderFromSun uint
	Composition string
	Rings bool
}

type Earth struct {
	Planet // Earth "is-a"" planet
	Moons uint
}
```

Earth "is-a" Planet when the field is anonymous. Earth will inherit all fields from Planet. In this case, Planet is a concept, or template (class), not an object the Earth has.
