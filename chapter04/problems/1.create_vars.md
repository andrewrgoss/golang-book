**What are two ways to create a new variable?**

The first way to create a variable in Go is to use the `var` keyword, specify the variable name, set the data type (string in this case), and finally to use the `=` symbol for assignment. 

```go
var x string
x = "Hello World"
```

The second approach for creating a variable is easier and more commonly used. Using `:=` we can create a new variable and assign it a starting value. It is not necessary to specify the type either, the Go compiler is able to infer the type based on the literal value assigned to the variable.

```go
x := "Hello World"
```
