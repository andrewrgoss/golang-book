**What is scope and how do you determine the scope of a variable in Go?**

Scope pertains to use of variables in code based on range of placement. Go is lexically scoped using blocks. Basically this means that the variable exists within the nearest curly braces { } (a block) including any nested curly braces (blocks), but not outside of them. 

In this example, the variable is placed outside of the main function, meaning other functions can access this variable.

```go
var x string = "Hello World"

func main() {
  fmt.Println(x)
}

func f() {
  fmt.Println(x)
}
```
