**Our program began with package `main`. What would the files in the `fmt` package begin with?**

```go
package fmt
```

This is known as a “package declaration”. Every Go program must start with a package declaration. Packages are Go's way of organizing and reusing code. There are two types of Go programs: executables and libraries. Executable applications are the kinds of programs that we can run directly from the terminal. (in Windows they end with .exe) Libraries are collections of code that we package together so that we can use them in other programs. `Fmt` would fall into the category of a commonly-used library.
